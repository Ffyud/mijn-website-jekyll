# Build a website with Jekyll and publish it

With the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework (or [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator), you can create a proper website in a short amount of time and with little technical knowlegde. 

Websites made with Jekyll are simple, easy to maintain and versatile, since they are only static. Meaning it basically is just a bunch of files, without any database like for instance Wordpress needs. What's also nice is the fact that you can publish your website online for free on a lot of places, like Github Pages, Netlify or Digital Ocean.

## 1 Get started with your project

In order to build a Jekyll website you'll have to set up a couple of requirements on your own machine.

- Github (or any other way of using [Git](https://git-scm.com))
- Ruby
