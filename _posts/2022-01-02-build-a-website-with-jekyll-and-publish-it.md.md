# Build a website with Jekyll and publish it

With the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework (or [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator), you can create a proper website in a short amount of time and with little technical knowledge. 

Websites made with Jekyll are simple, easy to maintain and versatile, since they are only static. Meaning it basically is just a bunch of files, without any database like for instance Wordpress needs. What's also nice is the fact that you can publish your website online for free on a lot of places, like Github Pages, Netlify or Digital Ocean.

## 1 Get started with your project

In order to build a Jekyll website you'll have to set up a couple of requirements on your own machine.

- A Github account. Sign-up for an account [here](https://github.com/pricing).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally.
- Ruby, which comes installed on MacOS and most of Linux by default.
  
#### Configuring Git

Start the terminal so we can connect your Github account with git. First, set the your username and emailadres.

```
git config --global user.name "your github username"
```

```
git config --global user.email "your email adress"
```

You can list the configuration to check if *user.name* and *user.email* are correct.

```
git config --list
```

### 1.2 Set-up Ruby

Jekyll is build with Ruby, so you'll have to have it installed locally for your operating system. You can check if that is the case by checking it's version.

```
ruby -v
```

Use the official [installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Ruby uses RubyGems for package management. Jekyll is such a package or [*Gem*](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll).

## 2 Start a Jekyll project

## 3 Customized your website

## 4 Publish your website

Jekyll can be hosted for free on a lot of places, like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or on the free tier at Digital Ocean, called [App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/).

### 4.1 Publish via Github Pages

You can follow along with the instructions, or go see the official [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) for setting this up.

#### Turn on Pages
In order to publish your website on Github Pages, go to the page of your repository and navigate to *Settings* and then *Pages*.
