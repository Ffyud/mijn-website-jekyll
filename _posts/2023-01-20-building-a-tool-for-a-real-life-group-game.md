# Building a tool for a real life group game

A friend of mine organised a real life game for his friends once. It involved group assignments randomly across the neighbourhood, with a secret saboteur amongst them. The goal of the game was scoring the most points with the group assignments as well as pinpointing who the saboteur was at the end of the day. 

Now, this required alot of administration troughout the day. Documenting the group's answers, calculating points, coordinating and sending groups to different places at the right time and instructing the saboteur. It would be nice give the players a way to fill in answers or receive instructions on their phone.
